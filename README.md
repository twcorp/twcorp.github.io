//v1.1//
very basic html structure of my personal portfolio website, twcorp.github.io
only skeleton index.html, cleaned up and formatted
successfully showing on github pages
website displays correctly

//v1.2//
created styles.css
linked the styles.css to the index.html 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
asked chatgpt to format it to make it scalable
website displays correctly

//v1.3//
showed Claude the v1.2 styles.css and added more codes from recommendations
Claude said codes are very well made alrdy and just recommended minor improvements
Claude recommended using utilities but ill learn that later
website displays correctly
